<p>In early 2008, the BCCI announced the launch of the Indian Premier League, a new franchise based T20 league, which is among the first of its kind in the cricketing world. The league was based on the Premier League of England and the NBA in the United States
In order to decide the owners for the new league, an auction was held on 24 January 2008 with the total base prices of the franchises costing around $400 million.At the end of the auction, the winning bidders were announced, as well as the cities the teams would be based in: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mohali, and Mumbai. In the end, the franchises were all sold for a total of $723.59 million.The Indian Cricket League soon folded in 2008

The 8 teams that took part in the first edition of this league were:

<ul>
<li>Chennai Super Kings</li>

<h3>Controversies</h3>
<p>

The IPL was hit by a huge match fixing scandal while the 2013 edition was going on when three players from the Rajasthan Royals were arrested by the police for match fixing and the team director of the Chennai Super Kings was accused of betting.
Subsequently these two teams were banned for two years before the 2016 edition of the tournament leading to the introduction of two new teams-Rising Pune Supergiants and the Gujarat Lions.

<p>
The players from the two banned teams were then accommodated in these two new teams.MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina who were previously a part of Chennai Super Kings then went on to captain Pune and Gujarat respectively.Also before the 2016 edition
Pepsi cancelled its contract as the title sponsor of the IPL and VIVO,which is a chinese multinational technology company became the new sponsor.
