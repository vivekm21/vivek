<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The 2015–16 Premier League was the 24th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1992. The season began on 8 August 2015, and was scheduled to conclude on 15 May 2016.[6] However, the Manchester United vs Bournemouth fixture was postponed to 17 May 2016 on the final day due to a suspicious package inside Old Trafford. 

Chelsea began the season as defending champions of the 2014–15 season. AFC Bournemouth, Watford and Norwich City entered as the three promoted teams from the 2014–15 Football League Championship.

In the previous season, Leicester City spent much of the season in the relegation zone before a late run of form propelled them to a final position of 14th; remarkably, a year later they won the league for the first time in their 132-year history, becoming the 24th club to become English football champions, and the sixth club to win the Premier League.

The top 8 teams of this league were:

<ul>
<li>Leicester City</li>
<li>Arsenal</li>
<li>Tottenham Hotspur</li>
<li>Manchester City</li>
<li>Manchester United</li>
<li>Southampton</li>
<li>West Ham United</li>
<li>Liverpool</li>
</ul>
